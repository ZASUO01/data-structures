# Project 3 - Dictionary

## Objective

The objective of this work was to design, code, and evaluate different 
implementations of a word dictionary. A dictionary allows queries, 
insertions, deletions, ordered printing, and updating of an entry.

The goal was to compare two typical implementations: one based on a balanced 
search tree and another based on hashing with linked lists. 

## Complexity

The following is the complexity of the main functions of each dictionary implementation.

| Operation          | AVL Tree             | Hash Table           |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Insertion**      | O(log n)             | O(1) (average), O(n) (worst case) |
| **Deletion**       | O(log n)             | O(1) (average), O(n) (worst case) |
| **Query**         | O(log n)             | O(1) (average), O(n) (worst case) |
| **Print in Order** | O(n)                | O(n log n) (average), O(nÂ²) (worst case)|

The tree structure ensure that the insetion, deletion and query operations have the complexity O(log n).
The balancing and update after delete operations uses pointers manipulation which have a constant complexity.
This structure is naturaly ordered so to print all n elements it's O(n).

The eficiency of the insertion, deletion and query operations in the Hash Table depends on the collision rate.
In the worst case all elements are mapped to the same index which costs O(n). Normaly it's just an array index acces which
cost O(1). The hash table is not naturaly ordered. All the elements must be copied to a list and be ordered. This operation 
complexity is limited by the quick sort complexity both for normal and worst cases.

## Input

The program input is a file containing words and its meanings. Each file line has the following
format:

a \[applied\] concerned with concrete problems or data

where:
a - indicates the type of the entry (adjective, noun or verb).
applied - is the word
concerned with concrete problems or data - is the meaning.

All those entries should be inserted in a dictionary.

## Output

The program should print all the dictionary entries in alfabetical order and meanings insert order as the
following example:

bad (a)
1. immoral, evil
2. below average in quality or performance, defective
3. spoiled, spoilt, capable of harming

Next, it should print in the same way, all the elements that have no meaning.


## Memory Access

## How To Execute

- 1 Fist compile the program.
```sh
make
```
- 2 Execute with tree implementation.
```sh
make tree
```
- 3 Execute with hash implementation.
```sh
make hash
```
- 4 Plot vizualization.
```sh
make plot
```
- 5 Clean for another execution.
```sh
make clean
```
